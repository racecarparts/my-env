## my-env setup

These are some useful scripts and whatnot.  The setup script downloads some useful apps and sets up some terminal tom-foolery.  Intended for the [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) shell on OS X.

1. Run the setup script after pulling this down locally:

  ```
  $ chmod +x my-env-setup.sh
  $ my-env-setup.sh
  ```

2. Then setup iTerm prefs:  

  _open iTerm_  
  **Colors:**  
  Preferences -> [select profile] -> Colors :: Load Presets... -> Import ->   
  [browse to: ~/my-env/conf/iterm2/my-env.itermcolors]

  **Font for Powerline:**  
  Preferences -> [select profile] -> Text :: [Regular Font || Non-ACSII Font] -> Change Font ->  
  [select a 'powerline' font previously installed]  

Now you have a fancy terminal and OS X environment!
